**teg-rs** is a complete rewrite of the classic [TEG game](https://github.com/wfx/teg) in Rust.

"If I end up finishing this as a chaotic, stage-based system, it will replace TEG LS."

The goal is to create a clean, modern, and modular system for turn-based strategy games with customizable rulesets and board definitions.

## Features

- Flexible board structures loaded from RON files
- Planned support for different rulesets (TEG, Risk like, custom)
- Support for TUI and GUI frontends
- Optional networked multiplayer
